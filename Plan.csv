Total Profit = Â£,69808.5864

Extra research if expanding Ice Cream machine production capacity increases
    Total Profit and limits unsatisfied demand. Note also more strawberries
    will be used for the extra ice cream, so there is less unused fresh strawberies. 
    It doesn't make sense to increase freezer capacity since it is never in full capacity.
